The project demonstrates a modern webside portfolio.
I intend to use my porflolio to show case my best work from my University of Washington BootCamp course.
The project is build using the Twitter Bootstrap open source web design system.
Through exploring and working with the pre-fabbed bootstrap kit, I am now able to put together a decent looking website utilizing boot strap and custom css modifications.
More important then the looks of the site, is the responsive nature of the Bootstrap system.
Utilizing a couple media queries, the website will look decent on any common screen size.
